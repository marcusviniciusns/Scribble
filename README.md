# Scribble

Scribble, borrowing Microsoft's words, "is a small drawing program that poses a realistic trial run in the Windows programming environment of the traditional 'Hello, World!' Scribble lets the user _draw_ 'Hello, World!' (or any free-hand drawing) by using the mouse and then save the image in a file."
